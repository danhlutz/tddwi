# Introductory exercises

1. input type:  Vect n elem
   output type: Vect n elem

reverse would satisfy the type
reverse [] = []
reverse (x::xs) = append (reverse xs) [x]

2. input:  Vect n elem
   output: Vect (n * 2) elem

A function that repeats each list element twice
double [] = []
double (x::xs) = x :: x :: (double xs)

3. input:  Vect (1 + n) elem
   output: Vect n elem

pop (x::[]) = []
pop (x::xs) = xs

backpop (x::[]) = []
backpop (x::xs) = x :: (backpop xs)

4. input:  Bounded n, Vect n elem
   output: elem

getElem 0 (x::_) = x
getElem n (x::xs) = getElem (n-1) xs
